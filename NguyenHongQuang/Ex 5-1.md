# The meaning of subsumption is: 
A test criterion C1 subsumes C2 if and only if every set of test cases that satisfies criterion C1 also satisfies C2. This mean that if a test set sastify C1, it will also sastify C2. And by this, we can answer both question a) and b): And its a BIG yes since T1 sastify C1 and T2 sastify C2
 which lead to the fact that T1 sastify C2 and T2 sastify C1
 
# c)
Since the fault does not relate to the coverage criterion, this mean that there might be a special input in T1 that reach the incorrect state in the program, however this does not nesscersary mean that any test in T2 can also reavel the fault.
