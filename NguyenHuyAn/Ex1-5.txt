(a) The if-test needs to take account of negative values (positive odd numbers are taken care
of by the second test):
if (x[i]%2 == -1 || x[i] > 0)

(b) x must be either null or empty. All other inputs result in the fault being executed. We
give the empty case here.
Input: x = []
Expected Output: 0
Actual Output: 0

(c) Any nonempty x with only non-negative elements works, because the first part of the
compound if-test is not necessary unless the value is negative.
Input: x = [1, 2, 3]
Expected Output: 3
Actual Output: 3

(d) For this particular program, every input that results in error also results in failure. The
reason is that error states are not repairable by subsequent processing. If there is a
negative value in x, all subsequent states (after processing the negative value) will be
error states no matter what else is in x.

(e) Input: x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
Expected Output: 3
Actual Output: 2
First Error State:
x = [-3, -2, 0, 1, 4]
i = 0;
count = 0;
PC = at end of if statement, instead of just before count++
Thanks to Jim Bowring for correcting this solution. Also thanks to Farida Sabry for pointing
out that negative even integers are also possible in the solution to part (c).
Also, note that this solution depends on treating the PC as pointing to the entire predicate
x[i]%2 == -1 || x[i] > 0 rather than to the individual clauses in this predicate. If you
choose to consider states where the PC is pointing to the individual clauses in the predicate,
then you can indeed get an infection without a failure in part (d). The reason is that for
an odd positive input the erroneous first clause, x[i]%== 1, returns true. Hence the if
short-circuit evaluation terminates, rather than evaluating the x[i]>0 clause, as the correct
program would. Bottom line: Itâ€™s difficult to analyze errors when the the PC has the wrong
value!
