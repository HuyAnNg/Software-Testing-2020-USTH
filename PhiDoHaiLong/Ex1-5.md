#### findLast()
* (a)    
* (b)
* (c)
* (d)
* (e)
* (f)
#### lastZero()
* (a) This code return the index of the first zero appearance in x not the last one. In order to fix the code we need to modify the loop (invert it).

```
for (int i = x.length-1; i >= 0; i--)
```

* (b) All inputs start the loop so there is no test case that does not execute the fault.
* (c) 
* (d) Test case result in an error but not a failure

```
test: x=[6, 0, 1]; expected = 1; result = 1.
```
* (e) For the given test case the code begin the search from i = 0 and search for the 0. In here there is only one 0 so we will get i = 1 even the loop is a fault. The first error state is from the beginning when i = 0. 
* (f)
