a,
public static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)
 { Vector result = new Vector (a); // get all of a’s elements
 Iterator itr = b.iterator(); 
while (itr.hasNext()) { 
Object obj = itr.next(); 
if (!a.contains (obj)) { // already have a’s elements 
result.add (obj); 
}
 } 
return result; }
b,The choice of argument types and return types as Vector is suspect; 
best practice is to use the least specific type consistent with the specifier’s goals. 
In particular, if Vector is replaced with List, this solves some, but not all of the problems above. 
Replacing Vector with Set is probably an even better idea, assuming the arguments are really intended to be sets.

c,
Test case[1]
Vector v1 = new Vector();
Vector v2 = new Vector();

Test case[2]
Vector v1 = new Vector();
v1.add(2)
Vector v2 = new Vector();


Test case[3]
Vector v1 = new Vector();
Vector v2 = new Vector();
v3.add(2)

d,
public static Set union (Set a, Set b) 
 EFFECTS: if a or b is null throw NullPointerException 
 else return a new Set that is the set union of a, b 
 e.g. union (null,{}) is NullPointerException 
 e.g. union ({1,2},{2,3}) is {1,2,3} 
 e.g. union ({1,2},{cat,hat}) is {1,2,cat,hat} 
 e.g. union ({null},{cat,hat}) is {null,cat,hat} 
 e.g. union (a,a) is Set t st that t!=a, but t.equals(a)
