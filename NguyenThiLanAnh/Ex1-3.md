Ex 1-3

- Whenever we use software, we incur some risk. 
- The risk may be small and the consequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catastrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire development team wants the same thingâ€“to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.
- The risk can't be zero, but it can reduce.
